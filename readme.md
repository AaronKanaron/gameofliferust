very simple and unstable but works and is pretty fast

### Controls

Scroll to zoom
K pauses the simulation
L runs the next step in the simulation
Left Click toggles a square
R resets the map | conflicts

### Known problems
These will probably never be fixed
* * *
Will crash if you reset the grid before stopping the simulation (K)
The grid lines do not work and crash the game when enabled
